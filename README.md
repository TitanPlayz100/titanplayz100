Skyclash
- Spent several months making hypixel skywars but with different kits and perks, along with my friends who made the maps
- Learned about Java and understand all the memes about it being a bad language

Teti
- tetris web client very similar to tetrio singleplayer but merged many more gamemodes from techmino
- learned javascript and the horrible language design

Personal Website
- has many tetris links to amazing resources, has all my video guides, lots of public discord servers and YT channels tetris related
- has a small bio about me
- rawdogging html and css like a pro

PseudoHuman

I will occasionally decide to continue these projects for no reason, and even more rarely upload to my youtube channel which you should check out
