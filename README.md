# TitanPlayz's GitHub

Skyclash - Spent several months making hypixel skywars clone, understand all the memes about Java being bad.  
Teti - tetris web client, javascript has a horrible language design.  
Personal Website - many links to resources, video guides, YT channels tetris related, rawdogging html and css.  
PseudoHuman - school project, multiplayer online game working with nextjs for frontend and nodejs/bun for server.
***
I will occasionally continue projects for no reason, and even more rarely upload to my youtube channel which you should check out.  
Pretty good at tetrio and shmups, and made many datapacks for mc.  
> Fun fact: once upon a time I cubed on 3x3, 21s pb.
