# TitanPlayz's GitHub
Skyclash - Spent several months making hypixel skywars clone, understand all the memes about Java being bad
Teti - tetris web client, javascript has a horrible language design
Personal Website - many links to resources, video guides, YT channels tetris related, rawdogging html and css
PseudoHuman - school project, multiplayer online game working with nextjs for frontend and nodejs/bun for server

I will occasionally decide to continue these projects for no reason, and even more rarely upload to my youtube channel which you should check out
Pretty good at tetrio and shmups, and made many datapacks for mc

Fun fact: once upon a time i cubed on 3x3, 21s pb
